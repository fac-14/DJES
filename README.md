## Heroku link
[See it on Heroku here!](https://desolate-lake-72795.herokuapp.com/)
The above link should be pretty up-to-date. See below for instructions on how to ensure you see the latest version.

## How to set up and see the magic
1. Clone repo (make sure it's this FAC-14 one, not the Sunuwars one that we've forked!)
2. Run `psql` or `pgcli` on your command line
3. `CREATE DATABASE toolshare;`
4. `CREATE USER sunuwars WITH SUPERUSER PASSWORD 'sunuwars123';`
5. `ALTER DATABASE toolshare OWNER TO sunuwars;`

INSTEAD OF steps 2 to 5, another option is to do this:
`createdb toolshare -O sunuwars`
(or `createdb toolshare â€“owner=sunuwars`)

6. Create `config.env` in the project's root directory
7. Paste `DATABASE_URL = postgres://sunuwars:sunuwars123@localhost:5432/toolshare` into `config.env`
8. Create the local database tables: open the database with the login from `#7`, using `psql` or `pgcli`, and then paste in the contents of `db_build.sql` (press y to confirm destructive action).
9. `npm run dev`
10. Go to `http://localhost:4002/`
11. ???
12. Profit

## What was the idea?
Inspired by one of our FAC fellows, Michael, we decided that we wanted to give FAC members the opportunity to borrow and lend items. 

## Previous functionality:
Quoted from last week. Some of this functionality might not be there anymore. Let us know... :P
- user can search the database to see which items are listed
- user can request to borrow an item (request is added as an entry to the `loans` table)

Functionality we were so close to completing (the code does exist on the backend, so feel free to have a look):
- user can add an item for borrowing

Functionality we were less close to completing:
- user can narrow their search to available items (i.e. items not currently loaned out)

## Functionality added this week
- User can register
- User can login
- After registration/login, a random session ID is created and stored in our `active_sessions` table
- Logged-in status is verified by checking the session
- The authorised user sees a different homepage

## Known issue
- Not at all mobile responsive. Very delicate layout/css as almost all time has been spent on back-end or front-end scripting rather than responsiveness, etc.

## Warnings
- The code is a bit of a mess at some points. We definitely reached one of the circles of Callback Hell, and mixing-in promises with the callbacks has made things a bit more confusing.
- As mentioned above, it's not at all responsive. Please view on widescreen!


Enjoy!
